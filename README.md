# AI Language Teacher

An open-source, local AI language teacher, starting with Japanese.

The goal is a tutor that checks real mastery before unlocking the next stage,
adapts lessons to student performance, and later supports speaking practice,
all without paid cloud services.

> Status: early development (v0.1.0). Hiragana vowels only.

## Features (current)

- Item-level knowledge tracking (per character, not just per skill)
- Questions, assessments and lessons as small, tested building blocks
- First lesson: Hiragana vowels (あ い う え お)
